# Notes-on-recently-read-paper
Notes on papers that I recently read, including some of my experiments.

Lately, my focus has been on absorbing and analyzing papers that are central to my current research interests. Specifically, I've been immersing myself in the following topics:

1. Federated Learning: A subject that has captured my attention is federated learning. Through extensive reading, I'm acquiring a comprehensive understanding of this innovative approach to machine learning. The nuances of distributed training across various devices while preserving data privacy have proven to be particularly intriguing. I'm now under the guidance of professor [Hao Wang](https://intellisys.haow.ca/haowang/) on this field.

2. Dynamic Object Detections (Robotics vision): Another captivating avenue of study involves dynamic object detections. My recent reading materials have revolved around this dynamic field, where I've been exploring techniques and breakthroughs in detecting and tracking objects in real-time scenarios. I'm now under the guidence of professor [Donghyun Kim](https://www.cics.umass.edu/people/kim-donghyun) in this field.

These themes have ignited my intellectual curiosity and prompted me to embark on practical experimentation. I'm diligently conducting experiments to gain hands-on experience and deeper insights into the concepts presented in the papers. These experiments are meticulously documented within the respective subfolders, ensuring that each trial's results and observations are well-captured.
